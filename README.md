# Zvonok

Like your doorbell, but from the future. With webui, text-to-speech and i18n. Who needs doorbell which is not powered by modern web technologies?

## Configuration

There is `config.json` file used for configuration. You can specify `host`, `port`, and `repeatCount` here.

## Doorbell.wav

I got it from here https://www.freesound.org/people/guitarguy1985/sounds/69385/. It's CC0 1.0.
